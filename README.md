# ⚡ EV Charging Scheduler - Production OpenEnv Environment

A sophisticated, production-ready OpenEnv environment for optimizing electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling across distributed charging infrastructure.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern electric grids face critical challenges:
- **Peak demand management**: Grid overload during high charging periods
- **Cost optimization**: Dynamic electricity pricing requires intelligent scheduling
- **Infrastructure constraints**: Limited charging stations vs. growing EV fleet
- **Priority management**: Emergency vehicles and time-constrained deadlines

The **EV Charging Scheduler** environment enables AI agents to learn optimal charging policies that balance cost, efficiency, and reliability.

## 🎮 Action Space

Agents interact by commanding charging actions:

```python
{
    "action_type": "assign",           # or "delay"
    "vehicle_id": 5,                   # Target vehicle
    "station_id": 2,                   # Target station (for assign)
    "power_level": 0.8,                # Normalized power (0-1)
    "duration": 1                      # Duration in time steps (optional)
}
```

**Valid Actions:**
- `assign`: Assign vehicle to a charging station with specified power level
- `delay`: Hold vehicle in queue (wait for better conditions)

---

```python

    "vehicles": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "battery_level": 0.35,        # Current charge (0-1)

            "occupied_slots": 2,
            "available_power": 50.0       # kW available
        },
        # ... more stations
    ],
    "grid": {
        "current_load": 0.75,            # Normalized (0-1)
        "max_load": 1.0,                 # Overload threshold
        "electricity_price": 0.182,      # $/kWh (dynamic)
        "time_step": 45
    },

agent = RandomAgent()
task = create_easy_task()
obs = task.reset()

for _ in range(100):
    action = agent.get_action(obs)
    obs = task.step(action).observation
```

### GreedyAgent

```python
from ev_charging_env import GreedyAgent

agent = GreedyAgent()
action = agent.get_action(obs)
```

### PriorityAwareAgent
Prioritizes urgent vehicles while managing grid load.

```python
from ev_charging_env import PriorityAwareAgent

agent = PriorityAwareAgent()
action = agent.get_action(obs)
```

### OptimalSearchAgent

```python
from ev_charging_env import OptimalSearchAgent

## 🧠 Using with OpenAI API

The `inference.py` script uses OpenAI's API to control the agent:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
python inference.py
```

The API-based agent:
1. Receives environment observation
2. Makes decision via GPT-4
3. Returns action in JSON format
4. Steps environment and provides feedback loop

---

## 📊 Performance Evaluation

Run inference script to evaluate agent across all three tasks:

```bash
python inference.py
```

Output:
```
============================================================
FINAL RESULTS
============================================================
EASY      : 0.715
MEDIUM    : 0.682
HARD      : 0.621

AVERAGE   : 0.673

Scores are normalized to [0.0, 1.0]
1.0 = Perfect performance on task
0.0 = No progress
```
